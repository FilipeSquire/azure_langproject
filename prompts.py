7. Financial Highlights 

This is a really important section. Here provide key financial commentary on the financial results of last three years 

This section is divided into two sub-sections. The first sub-section is a table with financial results of the latest three years. The second sub-section is commentary on the results 

Financial results table: This includes revenue, revenue growth%, gross profit, gross profit margin%, EBITDA, EBITDA margin%, operating cash flow, taxes paid, net working capital, capex, other investing cash flow, CFADS, financing cash flow and its components (e.g. debt issuance, debt repayment etc.),  Change in cash and cash equivalents, opening cash, closing cash, total debt (short term and long term external borrowings), net debt, and leverage (net debt/EBITDA) 

Financial commentary: This is based on the financial results but are in the form of bullet points commenting on the changes over the past three years. This includes increase/decrease in revenues, profitability (EBITDA) and debt. Please do mention the reasoning behind the changes too. Other than these, try commenting on net working capital as well as capex, and any metric which has varied a lot in any of the year and their reasoning. We always want to understand the reasoning. In addition, provide maybe a bullet point on the outlook from any credit rating agency if available in their latest credit rating report. 

Format should be in the form of bullet points e.g. - During FY24 volume decreased 6.1% y-o-y to 39.5m units, reflecting customers’ inventory optimization strategies, longer than expected customer plant stoppages, and slower than expected shift toward e-mobility. - Revenues decreased 1.7% to $4.9b, as re-pricing and underutilized capacity commercial negotiations partially offset volume decline EBITDA increased by 9.4%, however, to $633m, on the back of cost-optimization measures, customer negotiations and the depreciation of the Mexican peso - In FY23, the incremental debt responded to transitory needs, derived from higher working capital and the setup of the three new facilities for the EV/SC segment - Moody's stable outlook reflects expectations of continued cost-cutting, deleveraging, and prudent liquidity management to support improving credit metrics through FY25
